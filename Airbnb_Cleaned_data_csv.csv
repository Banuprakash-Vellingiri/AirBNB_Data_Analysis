The only downside is that it is on the 4th floor - with no elevator, however this has not caused problems as yet and the price is set to reflect this (please refer to the many positive reviews on this listing, as well as my 'room only' listing). It can be counted as 5th floor (though the letterbox is 4th floor) There is a double & a single bedroom. The kitchen & living areas flow into the open space.

It’s really cozy and romantic and it has a lot of natural light because of the 4 HUGE windows. 3 - EVERYTHING that you need to an AWESOME stay is provided to you and I'll be available to help you whenever you need!  Here are 3 THINGS TO CONSIDER before renting the HAVEN 249 Boavista: 1 - This is an apartment witch means that we have neighbours, so no loud music or any kind of loud noise is permitted after 11:00PM in our home. 2 -  There is currently NO AIR CONDITIONING in this unit because for that we would have to alter the characteristics of the building. 3 - Like any other older buildings, the sound isolation is not the best one because the characteristics of the building facade CAN NOT be altered, but we are really used",Apartment,Entire home/apt,Real Bed,1,1125,strict_14_with_grace_period,2,1.0,1,83,1,25.0,0.0,10.0,,10,2,,34904037,Vasco Santos,"Porto, Porto District, Portugal",,no,no,6,yes,11,20,20,20,"Porto, Porto, Portugal",,"Cedofeita, Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, Nicolau, Vitória",PT,41.15725,-8.62821,Portugal,11,20,20,20,10,10,9,10,9,9,94,28913

LUXURY ★ Tropical Hawaiian  ★ OCEANFRONT ★ VIEWS!,"This condo has been recently remodeled and is stunning!  One bedroom with king size bed and a queen sleeper sofa with memory foam mattress in the living room.

Urban Venture @McGill Ghetto Social experience,"We live in a Victorian townhouse spread on two floors. There are two rooms on the main floor, where the kitchen and the living room is.

The living room is often used as a psuedo-base for our operations with supplies stocked and there might be a small commotion during the mornings. On the bright side you will run into many sociable people.  Even with all the people around you will definitely have exclusive access to your room but this stay is more about the memories you will take home and the ideas we will share than about sleeping in your room.

Pulitzer Extra- Read all about our experiences!,"One day a guest said to us, “The Pulitzer is a happening place. I love it!” And that is exactly what it is. Far from being a collection of rooms, the Pulitzer is a place with a pulse, where there are always things happening, where every day is different. It is decidedly ‘cool’: a destination in its own right. The Pulitzer is a boutique hotel located right in the heart of Barcelona, a stone’s throw from Plaza Catalunya.

Square Saint-Louis.,"Three elements make our apartment stand out: The ideal location, the area, and the apartment itself. Montreal is a city which is easily accessible on foot, but you can also cycle, and public transport is ok... if you are staying in an area that is well connected to the shopping districts, academic institutions and the city center. Which is the case for our apartment. The Plateau Mont-Royal area is renowned. It is huge. The neighborhood of Carré Saint-Louis is without a doubt the most popular area because of the perfect blend of charming houses, vibrant streets and incredible green spaces. Nestled between the Lafontaine park and the Mont-Royal, our local square, with its fountain and its pavilion where you can enjoy an espresso, is unique.
